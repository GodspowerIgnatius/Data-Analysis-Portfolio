### Project Overview
This project analyzes over **48,000 rows** of pizza sales transactions from a fast-growing pizza chain to uncover sales trends, product performance, and customer preferences. Using **Microsoft Excel**, I built an interactive dashboard to identify best-selling pizzas, detect slow movers, analyze time-based sales trends, and provide actionable insights to help management optimize pricing, menu planning, and inventory.

### Tools Used
* Microsoft Excel
* Power Query (for cleaning and transformation)

### Steps
* Cleaned the raw dataset by fixing ingredient typos (e.g., “?duja” → “Nduja”) and handling missing or invalid entries.
* Created derived fields such as **Month, Year, Price Buckets, and Time of Day** to support trend analysis.
* Unpivoted pizza ingredients to enable ingredient-level performance insights.
* Built KPIs and pivot-based visualizations covering sales trends, pizza size, category, and ingredients.
* Designed a clean, interactive Excel dashboard combining KPIs, charts, and slicers (Date, Category, Size, Price Range).

### KPIs
* **Total Orders:** 21,350
* **Total Pizzas Sold:** ~49,000
* **Total Revenue:** $817,860
* **Average Order Value:** $38
* **Top Size:** Large pizzas lead in both sales and revenue.
* **Top Categories:** Classic and Chicken pizzas dominate total revenue.
* **Top Ingredients:** Garlic, Tomatoes, and Red Onions appear in the best-selling pizzas.
* **Peak Sales Hours:** Afternoon and Evening periods drive the majority of revenue.

### Recommendations
* **Prioritize Large Pizzas** – The most popular size; focus inventory and marketing around them.
* **Focus on Sweet Spot Pricing ($16–$25)** – This range drives most sales; maintain strong presence here while testing premium offers.
* **Leverage Top Performers** – Promote best-sellers like *Thai Chicken* and *Barbecue Chicken* through combo deals or limited offers.
* **Maximize Peak Hours** – Afternoon and evening sales dominate; strengthen staffing and run targeted campaigns during these times.
* **Revive Slow Movers** – Rebrand, reprice, or replace consistently low-selling variants (e.g., *Brie Carre*).
