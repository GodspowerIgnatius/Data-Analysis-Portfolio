# Supermarket Sales Analysis

### Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data from a supermarket to uncover trends, customer behavior, and product performance. Using Excel, I explored how sales vary by branch, product line, customer type, payment method, and time. An interactive dashboard was built to make insights clear and actionable.

Tools Used: Excel

### Steps
•	Cleaned and prepared supermarket sales dataset (Jan–Mar 2019).
•	Created pivot tables to summarize sales by product line, branch, gender, customer type, payment method, and time (months/quarters).
•	Applied formulas (VLOOKUP, INDEX + MATCH) to extract key data points.
•	Implemented data validation to prevent invalid quantity entries.
•	Built an interactive sales dashboard with KPIs (revenue, gross income, avg. order value, ratings, etc.) and visualizations (trend, product performance, customer type, payment, and branch)

### KPI
•	Total Revenue ($322,967),  Gross Income ($15,379), Average Order Value ($323), Quantity Sold (5,510), etc.
•	Top-performing products → Food & beverages lead with over $56K in revenue.
•	Customer types → Members contribute slightly more (51%) than Normal customers (49%).
•	Branch comparison → Revenue is evenly split across Mandalay, Yangon, and Naypyitaw.
•	Payment methods → Cash (35%) is most popular, followed by e-wallet (34%) and credit card (31%).
•	Price buckets → Products in the mid-high price range ($50–79 & $80–100) generate the most revenue.
