# Supermarket Sales Analysis

### Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data from a supermarket to uncover trends, customer behavior, and product performance. Using Excel, I explored how sales vary by branch, product line, customer type, payment method, and time. An interactive dashboard was built to make insights clear and actionable.

Tools Used: Excel

### Steps
1. Cleaned and prepared supermarket sales dataset (Jan–Mar 2019).
2. Created pivot tables to summarize sales by product line, branch, gender, customer type, payment method, and time (months/quarters).
3. Applied formulas (VLOOKUP, INDEX + MATCH) to extract key data points.
4. Implemented data validation to prevent invalid quantity entries.
5. Built an interactive sales dashboard with KPIs (revenue, gross income, avg. order value, ratings, etc.) and visualizations (trend, product performance, customer type, payment, and branch)

### KPI
1. Total Revenue ($322,967),  Gross Income ($15,379), Average Order Value ($323), Quantity Sold (5,510), etc.
2. Top-performing products → Food & beverages lead with over $56K in revenue.
3. Customer types → Members contribute slightly more (51%) than Normal customers (49%).
4. Branch comparison → Revenue is evenly split across Mandalay, Yangon, and Naypyitaw.
5. Payment methods → Cash (35%) is most popular, followed by e-wallet (34%) and credit card (31%).
6. Price buckets → Products in the mid-high price range ($50–79 & $80–100) generate the most revenue.

### Recommendations
1. Strengthen loyalty programs for members and run campaigns to convert normal customers into members
2. Expand popular payment options and encourage digital payments for faster checkout.
