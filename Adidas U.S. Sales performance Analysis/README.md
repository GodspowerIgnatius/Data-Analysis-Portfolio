# **Adidas U.S. Sales Performance Analysis**

## **Project Overview**

This project analyzes **U.S. retail sales data for Adidas**, covering two full years of transactions across multiple regions, retailers, and product categories. The goal of the analysis is to uncover revenue trends, retailer performance, product profitability, and year-on-year growth to support better strategic decision-making.
Using **Microsoft Excel**, the dataset was cleaned, standardized, and modeled to produce an interactive dashboard highlighting key insights on revenue drivers, operating performance, seasonality, and sales channels.
