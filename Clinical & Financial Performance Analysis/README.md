### Project Overview
This project provides a **comprehensive clinical and financial analysis** of hospital data covering **55,000 patients** and over **$1.4 billion in total billings**. Using **Power BI**, I built a 3-page interactive dashboard that gives insights into **financial performance, patient demographics, and clinical outcomes**.

### Tools Used
* Microsoft Power BI

### Steps
* Cleaned and structured patient, billing, and clinical data for analysis.
* Built calculated measures (Average Bill, Length of Stay, Age, etc.) using **DAX**.
* Designed KPIs and visualizations for billing, patient demographics, and medical conditions.
* Created **3 dashboards**:
  1. **Patient Demographics** ‚Äì Gender, age groups, blood type, admission trends, and test results.
  2. **Clinical Insights** ‚Äì Medical conditions, test outcomes, length of stay, and medication distribution.
  3. **Financial Insights** ‚Äì Billing by insurance providers, hospitals, and admission type.
* Applied slicers (Gender, Age Group, Insurance Provider, Hospital, Medical Condition, Test Results) for interactivity and drill-down analysis.

### KPIs
* **Total Patients:** 55K
* **Total Billing:** $1.4bn
* **Average Bill per Patient:** $26K
* **Average Age:** 52 years
* **Average Length of Stay (LOS):** 15 days
* **Top Medical Conditions (by patients):** Diabetes (9,216), Arthritis (9,218), Hypertension (9,151), Cancer (9,140), Obesity (9,146), Asthma (9,095)
* **Gender Distribution:** Male ‚Äì 49.98% | Female ‚Äì 50.02%
* **Admission Types:** Elective (33.46%), Urgent (33.61%), Emergency (32.93%)
* **Medications:** Balanced distribution across Lipitor, Ibuprofen, Aspirin, Paracetamol

### Reommendations

* **Optimize Billing Practices** ‚Äì Standardize processes across insurance providers, since average bills vary slightly (~$25.4K‚Äì$25.6K).
* **Target Preventive Care** ‚Äì Chronic diseases (diabetes, hypertension, arthritis) dominate patient counts; prioritize awareness and preventive programs.
* **Manage Length of Stay** ‚Äì Most conditions average **15‚Äì16 days**; adopt clinical efficiency strategies to reduce LOS without compromising care.
* **Leverage Patient Demographics** ‚Äì Middle-aged and senior patients form the majority; tailor services, insurance negotiations, and care models accordingly.
* **Strengthen Test Accuracy** ‚Äì About one-third of test results are inconclusive; improving diagnostics can reduce re-admissions and costs.
* **Monitor Medication Utilization** ‚Äì Ensure rational drug use since medication distribution is evenly spread, signaling potential over-standardization.
